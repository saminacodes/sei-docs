## What Happens After Listing

### Immediate Benefits

Once your dApp is approved and listed, you gain access to:

**Visibility and Discovery:**

- Inclusion in DappRadar's comprehensive dApp directory
- Appearance in category-specific rankings
- Search discoverability across the platform
- Exposure to 1 million+ monthly visitors

**Analytics Dashboard:**

- Real-time tracking of key performance metrics
- User engagement statistics
- Historical data analysis
- Competitive benchmarking

### Data Tracking and Metrics

The DappRadar tooltip describes the UAW or user data as the 'number of unique wallet addresses interacting with a dapp's smart contracts'. So, to be counted by DappRadar, a user needs to make a blockchain transaction with your smart contract.

**Key Metrics Tracked:**

1. **Unique Active Wallets (UAW)**

   - Number of distinct wallet addresses interacting with your smart contracts
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly active user counts
   - User retention and growth trends

2. **Transaction Volume**

   - Total value processed through your dApp
   - Transaction count and frequency
   - Average transaction size

3. **Smart Contract Activity**

   - All on-chain interactions with your contracts
   - Function call frequency and patterns
   - Gas usage and optimization metrics

However, any dapp activity outside of the blockchain ecosystem is generally not tracked, which could account for discrepancies between its measurements and measurements reported from the dapps themselves

### Dapp Feature Page Showcase

Your approved dApp receives a dedicated page featuring:

- Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- Project description and media
- Social links and community resources
- Real-time performance metrics
- User reviews and community engagement
- Boost power from community support

## Integration Requirements for ERC-4337 Account Abstraction

**Prerequisites for ERC-4337 Integration:**

Before beginning the integration process, ensure you have: Deployed or identified the EntryPoint contract on Sei. Implemented Smart Contract Wallet following ERC-4337 specification

**Technical Components:**

1. **EntryPoint Contract**

   - Singleton contract handling transaction validation and execution
   - Standard format: `function handleOps((address,uint256,bytes,bytes,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes,bytes)[], address)`

2. **Smart Contract Wallets**

   - User accounts implemented as smart contracts
   - Custom validation logic and signature schemes
   - Gas abstraction capabilities

3. **Bundlers**

   - Network actors bundling multiple UserOperations
   - MEV searchers and validators facilitating transactions
   - Fee optimization and transaction ordering

4. **Paymasters** (Optional)
   - Smart contracts sponsoring gas fees
   - Custom payment logic (ERC-20 tokens, subscriptions)
   - User onboarding without native token requirements

### Integration Process with DappRadar

**Step 1: Configuration Setup**
Access to GitHub and our open source repository at https://github.com/dappradar/erc4337-configurations

**Step 2: Submit Configuration**
Your ERC-4337 configuration must include the following components:

1. **EntryPoint Configuration**

   - Contract address and ABI
   - Supported chain identifiers
   - Network-specific parameters

2. **Smart Contract Wallet Specifications**

   - Wallet factory addresses
   - Implementation contract details
   - Validation function signatures

3. **Bundler Integration**
   - Supported bundler endpoints
   - Fee calculation methods
   - Transaction ordering preferences

**Step 3: Testing and Validation**

## Data Tracking and Analytics

### How DappRadar Tracks Data

DappRadar employs sophisticated blockchain data indexing to provide accurate, real-time analytics:

**Data Sources:**

- Direct blockchain node connections
- Smart contract event monitoring
- Transaction pool analysis
- Cross-chain data aggregation

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**1. Unique Active Wallets (UAW)**

- Most important metric for user engagement
- Counts distinct wallet addresses interacting with smart contracts
- Available in daily, weekly, and monthly aggregations
- Trend analysis and growth tracking

**2. Transaction Metrics**

- Total transaction count per period
- Transaction volume in native tokens and USD
- Average transaction value
- Transaction frequency patterns

**3. Smart Contract Interactions**

- Function call distribution
- Contract usage patterns
- Gas consumption analysis
- Error rate monitoring

**4. Financial Metrics**

- Total Value Locked (TVL) for DeFi protocols
- Revenue generation (if applicable)
- Token price correlation
- Market capitalization impact

### Data Accuracy Considerations

**Factors Affecting Data Accuracy:**

1. **On-Chain vs Off-Chain Activity**
   In the trading card game Splinterlands, you make a blockchain transaction when you claim rewards, battle an opponent, open a card pack, stake your tokens, and so on. In this game, almost every action gets tracked by the blockchain. Now, look at Axie Infinity, where the gameplay takes place on centralized servers. The only on-chain actions for Axie Infinity include claiming rewards, breeding Axies and trading NFTs

2. **Contract Coverage**
   Ensure all relevant smart contracts are included in tracking for complete data accuracy

**Best Practices for Data Accuracy:**

- Provide comprehensive list of all contract addresses
- Include proxy contracts and implementation addresses
- Update contract lists when deploying new versions
- Monitor data discrepancies and report issues
